# Compose UI Android Experiment
Experimenting Navigation with Compose along with data communication between screens

## Tracker in the House
You can see the list of people in this house and who is in which room. 
You can also make someone go to a specific room.
Each person is wearing a different colored shirt. You can make them wear a different shirt only 
if it is available in the room where the person is and is not currently worn by someone else.
